SKYEngine is planned to be a robust gaming engine for Java supporting GL 2 and eventually GL 3 using LWJGL.

Currently I am working on implementing the thread pool and the robust timer that will allow for priority scheduling of tasks to prevent visible lag within the gameplay as much as possible and allow for prioritization of things on the fly based upon the thread workload and other factors such as distance from player view and workload type.
